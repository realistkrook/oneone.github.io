      <p>In today's world, protecting yourself online is as important as protecting your house or car. Hackers are always looking for ways to exploit vulnerabilities and steal your personal information. But fear not! By taking some simple steps you can build a strong defence to stay protected online.</p></div>

      <h2>Passwords</h2>
        <p>You can imagine passswords being the key to your account, where you need to unlock the door to get in. Passwords open those doors so only you can access them. Weak passwords like your birthday or pet names are easy to guess and leave your accounts easy to get into. <br> The key is to create <b>strong</b> passwords. Heres how:</p>
      
      <ul class="overviewlist">
      <li><b>Size matters:</b> Try to make your passwords at least 12 characters long, the bigger the better.</li>
      <li><b>Mix it up:</b> Combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols for added complexity.</li>
      <li><b>Device Information:</b>  Don't reuse the same password for multiple accounts. A password manager can help you create and store unique passwords securely.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="infodiv">
      <div class="updateimg"></div>
    <h2>Software Updates</h2>
    <p>Just like a knight's armor needs constant maintenance, your software needs regular updates to stay secure. These updates often contain patches that fix vulnerabilities hackers could exploit.</p>
    <ul class="overviewlist">
        <li><b>Why Updates Matter:</b> Outdated software is like having cracks in your armor, making you an easier target for attackers.</li>
        <li><b>Enable Automatic Updates:</b> Most software offers automatic updates. Enable this feature to ensure you're always protected with the latest security patches.</li>
      </ul></div>

      <h2>Watch What Your Clicking</h2>
      <p>Phishing scams and malware are like digital booby traps waiting to ensnare unsuspecting users. Here's how to avoid them:</p>
      <ul class="overviewlist">
        <li><b>Think Before You Click:</b> Don't click on weird links in emails or messages, even if they appear to be coming from a trustworthy souce. Hover over them to see the actual URL before clicking. And remember, some URLs might try to trick you, like instead of facebook.com it could be facebook.xyz or facebook.net.</li>
        <li><b>Beware of Attachments:</b> Be cautious about opening attachments from unknown senders. They might contain malware disguised as harmless files.</li>
        <li><b>Question Everything:</b> If something seems too good to be true online, it probably is. Be wary of weird offers and promotions.</li>
      </ul></div>
      
      <div class="infodiv">
        <div class="twofaimg"></div>
      <h2>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Double the Security</h2>
      <p>Think of 2FA as an extra lock on your digital door. It adds an additional layer of security beyond just your password.</p>
      <ul class="overviewlist">
        <li><b>How it Works:</b> When you enable 2FA, you'll receive a code (via text message, authentication app) after entering your password. This code is needed to log in to your account, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.</li>
      </ul></div>
      
      <div class="infodiv">
        <div class="bodyguardimg"></div>
      <h2>Antivirus and Anti-Malware Software: Your Digital Bodyguards</h2>
      <p>Antivirus and anti-malware software are like digital bodyguards, constantly scanning your device for threats.</p>
      <ul class="overviewlist">
        <li><b>Think Before You Click:</b> These programs detect and remove malicious software (viruses, malware) that can steal your information or hurt your device.</li>
        <li><b>Keeping it Updated:</b> Just like your knowledge of self-defense needs to be updated, so does your antivirus software. Ensure you have a reputable antivirus program installed and keep it updated with the latest definitions to stay protected against new threats.</li>
      </ul></div>
